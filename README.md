Pablo is a simple and fairly magical editor specially designed to make all creative writers fall in love with it. It eliminates the unnecessary and excessive appurtenances that normally come shipped with other enterprise word processing giants like Microsoft Word and LibreOffice Writer. Pablo is stripped to the bare features required for writing fiction and poetry, plus additional support features to help the writer achieve his designs.

Pablo is designed to be unobtrusive, does not get in your way

You are Aladdin!

### Build
If you have Python 3.6 installed, you may quickly run the main.py file inside the src folder.

<a href="https://www.pyinstaller.org/">PyInstaller</a> is default for building a standalone application: run the pablo.spec file like these:

`pyinstaller build-dir.spec` for --onedir mode (recommended as it loads app quicker), or

`pyinstaller build-file.spec` for --onefile mode

NSIS is used to create a setup file for Windows users
