Pablo is a simple and fairly magical editor specially designed to make all creative writers fall in love with it. It eliminates the unnecessary and excessive appurtenances that normally come shipped with other enterprise word processing giants like Microsoft Word and LibreOffice Writer. Pablo is stripped to the bare features required for writing fiction and poetry, plus additional support features to help the writer achieve his designs.

Pablo is designed to be unobtrusive, does not get in your way

You are Aladdin!
